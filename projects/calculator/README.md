This project is the last project in the Web Dev 101 path for The Odin Project.

This project took ~ 20 hours to complete. It helped me improve my understanding of Event Handling, as well as moving into writing JavaScript in ES6 formatting. I had lots and lots of fun creating this calculator and I am really proud of how much I have managed to complete on my own with little researching required. Thanks to TOP community as always for help with minor questions, but for the first time in my journey to becoming a Full Stack Web Developer and Software Engineer, I feel like I was able to start thinking like a developer and how I decided to focus on solving small problems in turn solving the large problem.
