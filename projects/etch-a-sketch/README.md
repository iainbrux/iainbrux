/-- COMPLETED --/

This DOM manipulation project was set to me by The Odin Project: a free, open-source, online community of aspiring self-taught developers. This project is the first of all future projects that I will be completing through TOP, in which I will be adding them all to my portfolio alongside personal projects. Please note that this project was completed before the introduction of learning ES6 in the curriculum which is actually the next module after this assignment.

Total project completion time was around 100 hours.

What I learned:

I really dug deep into DOM manipulation with this project, plenty of hours spent researching(*cough* googling *cough*), asking questions to the TOP discord as well as friends who are senior software engineers. I learned that ES5 was also limiting some of the functions I wanted to write in my main.js file and hence I had to study, learn and write some functions in ES6. I haven't fully yet dived into ES6 but it is next on TOP's syllabus. I learned that it's important to research in the correct way, and also how to break down one big problem into smaller problems which then once completed bit-by-bit come together to complete the big problem. I also learned some self-discipline and time-management as well as the fact that I can put my mind to something and complete it, which is a big personal achievement for myself too. 

What I enjoyed:

I enjoyed writing the main.js file the most out of it all, and I feel like JavaScript is a language I will really want to study and learn plenty of libraries for for my front-end developer career.

What I didn't enjoy as much:

Writing the HTML and CSS. I feel that I didn't enjoy this as much because I haven't fully dived into HTML or CSS as much as JavaScript yet and at times felt a bit lost. Thankfully, researching the problems I had helped me understand what I wasn't doing correctly and in turn allowed me to correct my mistakes. As I complete The Odin Project there is a massive module on just purely HTML and CSS which once I have completed, I am certain will make me understand into more depth about these two languages.

-- FUTURE PLANS --

Rewrite code into ES6, simplify and shorten code for easier readability to prevent repetitive unnecessary code.
Ensure CSS has no overspill on 1080p monitors.
Tidy, simplify and shorten CSS as well as HTML.

Anything extra will be added above.

-- CREDITS --

Thanks to jakemezz for the help understanding how to size my divs based off the container div size in px, and then adding that to the css through JavaScript!
Thanks to jamie for the help with understanding about how the clear button should work, but not telling me the solution so I could research and conclude myself!
Thanks to TOP discord for small questions in regards to JavaScript functions, and helping me embrace the thought process of a developer.
